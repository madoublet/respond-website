        <h1>Respond 6</h1>
        <p>Respond has always been about taking the best of modern development technologies and applying them to the CMS space.  We were among the first to embrace responsive design, the Bootstrap front-end framework, SPA-powered apps, and web components.  We did this not to be first, but rather to provide a better user experience to our end users and developers. So, when we set out to develop Respond 6, we looked for innovative ways to continue to improve Respond.  We focused on three key areas: modernizing our technology stack, improving our overall user experience, and building a best-in-class developer experience.</p>

        <h3>Modern Technology Stack</h3>
        <p>Respond 6 is powered by a modern technology stack. On the backend, we stuck with PHP because of its stability, ubiquity, and overall cost effectiveness.  But, we moved from a custom PHP stack to the <a href="https://lumen.laravel.com/">Lumen</a> framework from the team at Laravel.  Lumen is a well-documented, light-weight framework that works great for REST APIs.  In addition, we completely removed database dependencies from the CMS.  So, the CMS is completely powered by the content of the sites and JSON setup files.  For the app, we chose the component-based <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular 2</a> framework.  Angular 2 gives us a beautiful code-base that can easily be extended. The new visual editor is powered by <a href="https://hashedit.io">Hashedit</a>.  Hashedit is a beautiful, visual editor created by the Respond team.  But, it is now decoupled from the CMS.  Finally, we re-engineered sites created by the CMS to be completely static.  There are now no dependencies on the app itself.  So, you can run them on the same server as Respond or even deploy them to static based hosting service (like Amazon S3) to lower your hosting costs.  The combination of Lumen, Angular 2, Hashedit, and static HTML gives Respond a power stack to develop your sites.</p>

        <h3>Improved User Experience</h3>
        <p>A hallmark of the Respond experience has always been a great user experience.  For Respond 6, we improved the UX of the app by completely redesigning the editing experience to be a completely visual experience. For the end user, this means you are editing the site as it appears in the browser.  This aligns the editing experience with the user's mental model and greatly reduces the need for training.  We have also pulled forward common use cases such as forms, galleries, and menus so that they can easily be editing without having to drill down to the pages in the app. Finally, we have made the whole experience lightning fast and completely mobile so that Respond users an edit pages quickly from anywhere.</p>

        <h3>Improved Developer Experience</h3>
        <p>A key aspect of a CMS that is often ignored, is the developer experience when building sites, themes, and plugins. For Respond 6, we made this a priority during development. We asked ourselves: if it is so easy to create a site from scratch, why is it so difficult to develop a theme or plugin.  Just look at the mess of documentation required to create a theme or plugin for the most popular content management systems.  Respond 6 is different.  We focused on making it really easy to build themes and plugins.  We developed two key technologies to do so.  We call the first one "sites as themes".  And, it as simple as it sounds.  To build a theme for Respond 6, you simply build a site and follow some really easy-to-follow best practices.  Our themes actually can run in a browser.  The second is a plugin system that enables you to build plugins with a little JSON and an HTML snippet. Respond 6 has by far the simplest themes and a plugins of any other CMS. Period. We think this will create a CMS that you love to develop with.</p>

        <p>I think the combination of a great technology stack, an improved UI, and a best-in-class developer experience will make Respond 6 a system that you (and your customers) will love to use.</p>
