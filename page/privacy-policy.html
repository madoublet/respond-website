      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <h2>Your privacy is important to us.  Here are a few of our core principles:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>We don't ask for information unless we need it</li>
        <li>We don't require any information to create a site, you enter as much or as little as you are comfortable with</li>
        <li>We only store what you enter on the server</li>
        <li>We use strong cryptography to store your password and do not store identifiable information in cookies/session</li>
        <li>We use <a href="http://stripe.com">Stripe</a> to process Credit Cards.  We do not store your Credit Card Information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
      <p>Like most website operators, Respond collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of
        each visitor request. Respond’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Respond’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Respond may release non-personally-identifying information
        in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.
      </p>
      <p>Respond also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Respond only discloses logged in user addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying
        information as described below.
      </p>
      <h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
      <p>Certain visitors to Respond’s websites choose to interact with Respond in ways that require Respond to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Respond gathers depends on the nature of
        the interaction. For example, Respond users who sign up for our service enter their email, name, password, and property information.  We only require email, name, password, and address to create an account.  All other information
        is supplied at the discretion of the user.  Respond does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that
        it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.
      </p>
      <h3>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
      <p>Respond may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Respond may monitor listings on the site. Respond may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Respond does
        not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.
      </p>
      <h3>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
      <p>Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Respond’s
        behalf or to provide services available at Respond’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using
        Respond’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Respond will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors
        and affiliated organizations, as described above, Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Respond
        believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Respond, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Respond website and have supplied your email address,
        Respond may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Respond and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate
        this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify
        or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Respond takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying
        information.
      </p>
      <h3>Sessions</h3>
      <p>A session is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Respond uses sessions to help Respond identify and track visitors,
        their usage of Respond website, and their website access preferences. Respond visitors who do not wish to have sessions placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse sessions before using Respond’s websites, with
        the drawback that certain features of Respond’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.
      </p>
      <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
      <p>If Respond, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Respond goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party.
        You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Respond may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.
      </p>
      <h3>Ads</h3>
      <p>Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about
        you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Respond
        and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.
      </p>
      <h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
      <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Respond may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Respond’s sole discretion. Respond encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy.
        Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.
