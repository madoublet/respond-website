        "title": "Creating Plugins",
        "description": "Learn how to create plugins for Respond",
        "text": "Creating Plugins Plugins are a great way to extend Respond to meet the needs of your users.&nbsp; In Respond 7, plugins are managed globally and distributed to sites when you create the site or when you update the plugins from the advanced menu.&nbsp; Updating Plugins You can find the source code for the existing plugins in the \/resources\/plugins\/ folder.&nbsp; When you create your site with Respond, the sites theme folder will be copied over to your installation folder (\/public\/sites\/site-name) and then the \/resources\/plugins folder will be copied over to the site.&nbsp;&nbsp; To update the plugins, you simply update the code in this folder and then create a new site or update the plugins from the advanced menu \"Advanced &gt; Update Plugins\".Referencing Plugins in Code The respond-plugin attribute is used to tell the system that the code contained within an element is generated by a plugin. &lt;div respond-plugin type=\"form\" form=\"contact-us\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt; In the above example, the plugin is set to a type of form. This tells Respond to pull the code from public\/sites\/site-name\/plugins\/form.html. Enabling Plugins in the Respond Editor You can enable the Respond visual editor to show your plugin by adding the following JSON to \/resources\/plugins\/data\/plugins.json. The file is copied to public\/sites\/site-name\/data\/plugins.json when the site is created.&nbsp; Once again, changing this file will not affect existing sites until you update the plugins from the advanced menu. { \"selector\": \"[respond-plugin][type=form]\", \"title\": \"Form\", \"display\": \"&lt;i class=\\\"material-icons\\\"&gt;check_box&lt;\/i&gt;\", \"view\": \"&lt;div class=\\\"respond-plugin\\\"&gt;&lt;i class=\\\"material-icons\\\"&gt;check_box&lt;\/i&gt;&lt;span&gt;Form&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\", \"html\": \"&lt;div respond-plugin type=\\\"form\\\" form=\\\"contact-us\\\"&gt;&lt;\/div&gt;\", \"attributes\": [ { \"attr\": \"form\", \"label\": \"Form\", \"type\": \"select\", \"values\": [\"respond.forms\"] } ], \"assets\": [\"plugins\/form.html\"] } Setting Description action A unique identifier for your plugin. selector The CSS selector by which your plugin can be accessed by the editor. Typically, this will be [respond-plugin][type=plugin] where plugin is the name of your plugin. title The title of the plugin. Shown when the icon is hovered over. display The HTML display of the icon shown in the toolbar in the Respond editor. view (optional) Specifies \"default\" HTML that is replaced by the editor. This is recommended when the plugin contains dynamic data that should not be edited by the user. attributes The attributes allow you to configure the configure modal for the plugin. Each configurable item is mapped to an attribute on the plugin HTML. For example, in the form plugin, the form attribute sets the form attribute in the plugin HTML. More on Attributes Attributes are the primary means to pass data from the user to the plugin. They can pass plain text or specify the name of the form, gallery, or page to be used by the plugin. Setting Description attr The name of the HTML attribute to be set on the plugin. label The label for the field shown in the configure element modal type This can be set to text or select to show a text field or select field. values (if select is set as type) An array of values to be added on the select list. This can be a simple array of strings (e.g. ['Option 1','Option 2','Option 3']) or can be set as ['respond.forms'], ['respond.galleries'], ['respond.routes'], or ['respond.pages']. These special values automatically populate the select box with items created in Respond. Plugin Structure Plugins can be a simple as creating plain HTML. In fact, you can just specify the HTML in the plugins.json file. However, to get the full power of accessing Respond data, you need to use TWIG templates. The Twig templates allow you to access data in the system. An example of the form plugin is shown below. {% spaceless %} {% for form in forms %} {% if form.id == attributes.form %} &lt;form id=\"{{ form.id }}\" action=\"{{ site.api }}\" data-site=\"{{ site.id }}\" respond-form&gt; {% for field in form.fields %} &lt;div class=\"form-group\" data-id=\"{{ field.id }}\" data-label=\"{{ field.label }}\" data-type=\"{{ field.type }}\" data-required=\"{{ field.required }}\"&gt; &lt;label for=\"{{ field.id }}\" class=\"control-label\"&gt;{{ field.label }}&lt;\/label&gt; {% if field.type == 'text' %} &lt;input id=\"{{ field.id }}\" name=\"{{ field.id }}\" type=\"text\" placeholder=\"{{ field.placeholder }}\" class=\"form-control\"&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'textarea' %} &lt;textarea id=\"{{ field.id }}\" name=\"{{ field.id }}\" placeholder=\"{{ field.placeholder }}\" class=\"form-control\"&gt;&lt;\/textarea&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'select' %} {% set options = field.options|split(',') %} &lt;select id=\"{{ field.id }}\" name=\"{{ field.id }}\" class=\"form-control\"&gt; {% for option in options %} &lt;option value=\"{{ option }}\"&gt;{{ option }}&lt;\/option&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;\/select&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'checkboxlist' %} {% set options = field.options|split(',') %} &lt;span class=\"radio list\"&gt; {% for option in options %} &lt;label class=\"radio\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"{{ field.id }}\" type=\"checkbox\" value=\"{{ option }}\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ option }}&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/label&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;\/span&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.type == 'radiolist' %} {% set options = field.options|split(',') %} &lt;span class=\"checkbox list\"&gt; {% for option in options %} &lt;label class=\"checkbox\"&gt;&lt;input name=\"{{ field.id }}\" type=\"radio\" value=\"{{ option }}\"&gt;&lt;span&gt;{{ option }}&lt;\/span&gt;&lt;\/label&gt; {% endfor %} &lt;\/span&gt; {% endif %} {% if field.helperText != '' %} &lt;span class=\"help-block\"&gt;{{ field.helperText }}&lt;\/span&gt; {% endif %} &lt;\/div&gt; {% endfor %} {% endif %} {% endfor %} &lt;button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\"&gt;Submit&lt;\/button&gt; &lt;span class=\"loading\"&gt; &lt;!-- ack: https:\/\/github.com\/jxnblk\/loading --&gt; &lt;svg xmlns=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2000\/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 32 32\"&gt;&lt;g&gt;&lt;path opacity=\".25\" d=\"M16 0 A16 16 0 0 0 16 32 A16 16 0 0 0 16 0 M16 4 A12 12 0 0 1 16 28 A12 12 0 0 1 16 4\"\/&gt;&lt;path d=\"M16 0 A16 16 0 0 1 32 16 L28 16 A12 12 0 0 0 16 4z\"&gt;&lt;animateTransform attributeName=\"transform\" type=\"rotate\" from=\"0 16 16\" to=\"360 16 16\" dur=\"0.8s\" repeatCount=\"indefinite\" \/&gt;&lt;\/path&gt;&lt;\/g&gt;&lt;\/svg&gt; &lt;\/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"success\"&gt;Form submitted successfully&lt;\/span&gt; &lt;span class=\"error\"&gt;There was an error submitting your form&lt;\/span&gt; &lt;\/form&gt; {% endspaceless %} Form Data Forms are created in the Forms UI in Respond.

        "text": "Creating Themes Respond 7 makes it easier than ever to create themes. In Respond, we like to say that Respond uses \"sites as themes\". This is because our themes are just standalone sites. They can be viewed in the browser without modification. In fact, when Respond creates a site, it simply copies the theme folder's contents over to the site's production folder. With that said, Respond does require the HTML to follow the bootstrap grid framework to be editable, and Respond relies on a few key components. That is why we believe the best way to create a theme is to copy an existing one and customize it to meet your needs. Existing themes can be found in your installation folder at public\/themes. You can simply copy the theme and update the folder name and the theme.json file with your theme's name and description. Now that you have a solid framework for creating your own themes, the rest of this documentation will walk you through the components of a theme and describe some best best practices that we follow when creating our own themes. Theme Components Themes consist of: (1) the HTML, CSS, and JS content of the theme, (2) the theme.json file, (3) the screenshot.png file and (4) the templates. The HTML, CSS, and JS content of the theme, The theme HTML, CSS, and JS is easily recognizable if you have developed a website before. Respond uses Bootsrap 4 to style its themes. You can use other frameworks, but that is out of the scope of this document. A subset of the theme code is shown below for demonstration purposes.&nbsp; We recommend that you structure documents with header, main, and footer elements.&nbsp; The header and footer are hidden in the editor by default.&nbsp; And, the main element should hold the editable content of your page.&nbsp; The main element should also have a role=\"main\" attribute.&nbsp; This attribute is key for editing and saving content.The content in the role=\"main\" element should also be set in the Bootstrap 4 grid with the .content, .row, .col nesting.&nbsp; This nesting enables elements in the .col block to be sortable.&lt;header role=\"banner\"&gt; ... &lt;\/header&gt; &lt;main class=\"content\" role=\"main\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"block row jumbotron\"&gt; &lt;div class=\"col col-md-12\"&gt; &lt;h1&gt;Beautiful themes built for speed&lt;\/h1&gt; &lt;p&gt;Take your idea from concept to completion faster by starting with our beautiful, responsive themes.&lt;\/p&gt; &lt;\/div&gt; &lt;\/div&gt; &lt;\/main&gt; &lt;footer&gt; ... &lt;\/footer&gt; The theme.json file The theme.json file is found at&nbsp;public\/themes\/theme-name\/theme.json. &nbsp;The role of this file is to provide Respond with meta data to display when creating your theme. { \"name\": \"Aspire\", \"desc\": \"Aspire is a bold, mobile-first design built to push your site forward.\" } Setting Description name The name of the theme. desc The description of the theme. Templates Templates hold the content that is used to create new pages and provide common headers and footers across pages. You can find the templates in the public\/themes\/theme-name\/templates\/ folder in your sites directory. Templates have their own unique syntax to inject common settings into your page. To change page settings, you use the settings in the page settings modal. Setting Description {{page.title}} The title of the page. {{page.description}} The description of the page. {{page.keywords}} The keywords of the page. {{page.tags}} The tags of the page. {{page.callout}} A short phrase to call attention to a page. {{page.url}} The url of the page (not editable in page settings). {{page.fullUrl}} The full url of the page (not editable in page settings). {{page.photoUrl}} The url of the selected photo for the page. {{page.fullPhotoUrl}} The full url of the selected photo for the page. {{page.thumbUrl}} The thumb url of the selected photo for the page. {{page.fullThumbUrl}} The thumb url of the selected photo for the page. {{page.language}} The selected language for the page. {{page.direction}} The text direction (ltr, rtl) for the page.. {{page.customHeader}} Custom HTML for the header of the page. {{page.customFooter}} Custom HTML for the footer of the page. Theme Best Practices BASE element Respond adds all links and images relative to the root of the site. As a result, pages in the theme must specify a base element relative to the root. For instance, pages in a \/page\/ subdirectory must have a base of &lt;base href=\"..\/\"&gt;. Sortable ellements must be positioned static or relative. These elements cannot be floated. Immediate children of sortable containers (see settings) must be positioned relative or static. They cannot be floated or positioned absolute. However, children of those children do not have that restriction. Specify a [role=\"main\"] One element on the page should be given a role=\"main\" attribute. Respond uses this as the main content of the page. This main content is searchable and added to the pages.json file so that it can be made available to plugins. Installing a theme Simply place the theme folder in resources\/themes.",

Tool Description Re-publish Plugins This tool walks through the pages in your site and re-publishes the plugins on each page. It does this by querying the DOM for the [respond-plugin] attribute and then updates the element with content from the associated plugin. This is helpful when developing or modifying plugins for your site. An error when executing this function typically means you have an error in your plugin. Re-index Pages This tool updates the current index (data\/pages.json) with new files in your site's directory. The tool also updates your sitemap.xml file. This tool allows you to bring in pages into Respond that you develop outside of the CMS. Re-publish Sitemap This tool updates your sitemap.xml file (but does not reindex your pages). Migrate Respond 5 site This tool aids in the process of migrating your site from Respond 5 to 6. More details below. R5 Migration Tool While the R5 migration tool does not completely move your site from R5 to R6, it does much of the heavy lifting. A list is outlined below: Removes web component JS Removes respond-language, respond-language-toggle, respond-cart, respond-cart-toggle, and respond-search tags Updates the respond-map tag with the R6 equivalent Updates the respond-html tag with the R6 equivalent Updates the respond-video tag with the R6 equivalent Updates the respond-gallery tag with the R6 equivalent Updates the respond-menu tag with the R6 equivalent Updates the respond-form tag with the R6 equivalent Updates the respond-list [type=blog] tag with the R6 equivalent Sets the [nav] element in the header to the primary R6 menu Removes [data-i18n] attributes Removes [data-nested] attributes Removes [data-backgroundimage] attributes Removes [data-backgroundstyle] attributes Removes [data-containerid] attributes Removes [data-containercssclass] attributes Removes [page] attributes Removes absolute links to images Publishes R6 plugins",

Create the directory structure for Respond You create your directory structure by navigating to your web root and creating folders for Respond. You can also do this using a graphical tool (such as sFTP). Below we are creating the following structure: var\/www\/html\/respond\/app. We are also adding a var\/www\/html\/respond\/app\/public\/sites folder that will hold the sites and a var\/www\/html\/respond\/app\/resources\/sites folder that will hold private data about your sites. \/\/ go to your HTML root cd var\/www\/html \/\/ create the respond directory mkdir respond \/\/ switch directories cd respond \/\/ create a directory to hold the app and sites mkdir app \/\/ change to the app directory cd app 2.

Default Configuration By default, email is sent out via the default mail provider configured on your server. If you followed the Digital Ocean installation or use another VPS, you probably don't have one. Some shared servers offer this as an option. But, we think it is much better to outsource to a provider that specializes in this. Email from the app is always sent out to the primary email setup on the account. Custom Configuration To setup a custom email provider, Respond provides an SMTP configuration option. This is located in the .env file in the root. Variable Description EMAILS_FROM The from email address for emails sent by the app. EMAILS_FROM_NAME The from name for emails sent by the app. IS_SMTP Specifies whether the email is sent via SMTP. SMTP_HOST The SMTP Host for the server sending the emails SMTP_AUTH The SMTP Auth flag. SMTP_USERNAME The username to access the SMTP server. SMTP_PASSWORD The password to access the SMTP server.

        "title": "Privacy Policy",
        "description": "Read our privacy policy.",
        "text": "Privacy Policy Your privacy is important to us. Here are a few of our core principles: We don't ask for information unless we need it We don't require any information to create a site, you enter as much or as little as you are comfortable with We only store what you enter on the server We use strong cryptography to store your password and do not store identifiable information in cookies\/session We use Stripe to process Credit Cards. We do not store your Credit Card Information. Website Visitors Like most website operators, Respond collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Responds purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Responds visitors use its website. From time to time, Respond may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website. Respond also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users. Respond only discloses logged in user addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information Certain visitors to Responds websites choose to interact with Respond in ways that require Respond to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Respond gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, Respond users who sign up for our service enter their email, name, password, and property information. We only require email, name, password, and address to create an account. All other information is supplied at the discretion of the user. Respond does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities. Aggregated Statistics Respond may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Respond may monitor listings on the site. Respond may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Respond does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Responds behalf or to provide services available at Responds websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Responds websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Respond will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Respond discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Respond believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Respond, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Respond website and have supplied your email address, Respond may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with whats going on with Respond and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Respond takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information. Sessions A session is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Respond uses sessions to help Respond identify and track visitors, their usage of Respond website, and their website access preferences. Respond visitors who do not wish to have sessions placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse sessions before using Responds websites, with the drawback that certain features of Responds websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies. Business Transfers If Respond, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Respond goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Respond may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy. Ads Ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by Respond and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers. Privacy Policy Changes Although most changes are likely to be minor, Respond may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in Responds sole discretion. Respond encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.",

        "title": "Respond 6 Beta",
        "description": "Learn more about what is coming as part of the Respond 6 beta",
        "text": "Respond 6 Respond has always been about taking the best of modern development technologies and applying them to the CMS space. We were among the first to embrace responsive design, the Bootstrap front-end framework, SPA-powered apps, and web components. We did this not to be first, but rather to provide a better user experience to our end users and developers. So, when we set out to develop Respond 6, we looked for innovative ways to continue to improve Respond. We focused on three key areas: modernizing our technology stack, improving our overall user experience, and building a best-in-class developer experience. Modern Technology Stack Respond 6 is powered by a modern technology stack. On the backend, we stuck with PHP because of its stability, ubiquity, and overall cost effectiveness. But, we moved from a custom PHP stack to the Lumen framework from the team at Laravel. Lumen is a well-documented, light-weight framework that works great for REST APIs. In addition, we completely removed database dependencies from the CMS. So, the CMS is completely powered by the content of the sites and JSON setup files. For the app, we chose the component-based Angular 2 framework. Angular 2 gives us a beautiful code-base that can easily be extended. The new visual editor is powered by Hashedit. Hashedit is a beautiful, visual editor created by the Respond team. But, it is now decoupled from the CMS. Finally, we re-engineered sites created by the CMS to be completely static. There are now no dependencies on the app itself. So, you can run them on the same server as Respond or even deploy them to static based hosting service (like Amazon S3) to lower your hosting costs. The combination of Lumen, Angular 2, Hashedit, and static HTML gives Respond a power stack to develop your sites. Improved User Experience A hallmark of the Respond experience has always been a great user experience. For Respond 6, we improved the UX of the app by completely redesigning the editing experience to be a completely visual experience. For the end user, this means you are editing the site as it appears in the browser. This aligns the editing experience with the user's mental model and greatly reduces the need for training. We have also pulled forward common use cases such as forms, galleries, and menus so that they can easily be editing without having to drill down to the pages in the app. Finally, we have made the whole experience lightning fast and completely mobile so that Respond users an edit pages quickly from anywhere. Improved Developer Experience A key aspect of a CMS that is often ignored, is the developer experience when building sites, themes, and plugins. For Respond 6, we made this a priority during development. We asked ourselves: if it is so easy to create a site from scratch, why is it so difficult to develop a theme or plugin. Just look at the mess of documentation required to create a theme or plugin for the most popular content management systems. Respond 6 is different. We focused on making it really easy to build themes and plugins. We developed two key technologies to do so. We call the first one \"sites as themes\". And, it as simple as it sounds. To build a theme for Respond 6, you simply build a site and follow some really easy-to-follow best practices. Our themes actually can run in a browser. The second is a plugin system that enables you to build plugins with a little JSON and an HTML snippet. Respond 6 has by far the simplest themes and a plugins of any other CMS. Period. We think this will create a CMS that you love to develop with. I think the combination of a great technology stack, an improved UI, and a best-in-class developer experience will make Respond 6 a system that you (and your customers) will love to use.",
